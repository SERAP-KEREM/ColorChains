## 📜 **Game Features**  

### 🔹 **Chain Mechanics**  
- 🔗 **Chain Constraints**:  
  Keys are attached to chains that restrict movement. Players must carefully plan their moves without breaking the chains.  
- ⚡ **Break Mechanism**:  
  - Chains will break if stretched beyond their maximum length or subjected to excessive stress.  

### 🔹 **Key and Socket Matching**  
- 🔑 **Keys**:  
  - Each key has a specific color that must match the correct socket.  
- 🟩 **Sockets**:  
  - Once all keys are placed in the correct sockets, **all clamps unlock, and the level is completed!**  

### 🔹 **Move Limit**  
- ⏳ **Limited Moves**:  
  - Players have a restricted number of moves.  
  - They must complete the level before running out of moves.
